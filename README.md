# Inter-process-communication-mechanisms-in-Linux
This project implements inter-process communication via pipes, reads files from memory and creates and puts to use shared memory areas.

This is the last project from the Operating Systems subject at my university.

It is about communication via pipes between different processes and sending commands and executing commands through pipes.

The demands of the project are described thoroughly in the "a3.pdf" file. Also there are indications on how to run and evaluate the project. 

The code written by me is only in the "a3.c" file, the rest of the files are needed for the project to work and were generated or created by the teacher who assigned the task to me.

This is intented to only work on Linux devices.
